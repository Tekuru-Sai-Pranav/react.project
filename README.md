**React Student Management Application**

This project is a React-based web application designed for managing student data, implementing fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
It utilizes react-router-dom for client-side routing, providing navigation between different views.

The application's structure includes a main App component that sets up the routing, with routes defined in ReactRouter.jsx. 
A Layout component provides a consistent structure, including a navigation bar (Nav) and an Outlet for rendering specific page content. 
The Nav component allows users to navigate to the "Home" page (which is the CreateStudent component) and the "View All" students page.
